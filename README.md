<p align="center"> Simple, Lightweight Wrapper For Vanilla JS </p>

## What is it ?
PickledVanilla is a simple, lightweight wrapper for Vanilla JS which combines multiple lines of code into single 1. its more like jquery
But its directly linked with VanillaJS instead of adding some middleman code

## Why ?
I was very bored with jquery script and wanted to try something else :see_no_evil:.
